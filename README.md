## Info on Geodesy ##

Geodesy is a geodetic library that allows the construction of basic shapes on a specified 
ellipsoid world model. You can then perform various operations on the shapes and points 
such as discovering distance, whether shapes intersect and such. The shapes can have altitude
but not an arbitrary 3D shape.

## Building ##

Setup your gradle.properties file appropriately after reading [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/) documentation.
Use Gradle to build, see the various tasks and use the Gradle documentation to understand what they do.
